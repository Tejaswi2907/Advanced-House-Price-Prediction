# Advanced House Price Prediction  

This project focuses on predicting house prices using **80 features** that capture various aspects such as street type, electricity, neighborhood characteristics, and structural details, with the target variable being **SalePrice**. The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand feature distributions, correlations, and outliers. Various visualizations, such as distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and boxplots, are used to analyze the data before and after preprocessing. The project aims to explore key factors influencing house prices and provides insights into real estate market trends.
